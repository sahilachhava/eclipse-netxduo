# Chapter 1 - Introduction to NetX Duo HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol designed for transferring content on the Web. HTTP is a simple protocol that utilizes reliable Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) services to perform its content transfer function. Because of this, HTTP is a highly reliable content transfer protocol. HTTP is one of the most used application protocols. All operations on the Web utilize the HTTP protocol. NetX Duo HTTP accommodates both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. IPv6 does not directly change the HTTP protocol, although some changes in the original NetX HTTP API are necessary to accommodate IPv6 and will be described in this document.

## HTTP Requirements

In order to function properly, the NetX Duo HTTP package requires that a NetX Duo (version 5.2 or later) is installed. In addition, an IP instance must already be created, and TCP must be enabled on that same IP instance. An IPv6 host application must set its link local and global IPv6 address using the IPv6 API and/or DHCPv6. The demo file in section "Small Example System" in **Chapter 2** will demonstrate how this is done.

The HTTP Client portion of the NetX Duo HTTP package has no further requirements.

The HTTP Server portion of the NetX Duo HTTP package has several additional requirements. First, it requires complete access to TCP well-known port 80 for handling all Client HTTP requests. The HTTP Server is also designed for use with the File embedded file system. If FileX is not available, the user may port the portions of FileX used to their own environment. This is discussed in later sections of this guide.

## HTTP Constraints

The NetX Duo HTTP protocol implements the HTTP 1.0 standard. However, there are following constraints:

1.	Persistent connections are not supported
2.	Request pipelining is not supported
3.	The HTTP Server supports both basic and MD5 digest authentication, but not MD5-sess. At present, the HTTP Client supports only basic authentication.
4.	No content compression is supported.
5.	TRACE, OPTIONS, and CONNECT requests are not supported.
6.	The packet pool associated with the HTTP Server or Client must be large enough to hold the complete HTTP header.
7.	HTTP Client services are for content transfer onlyâ€”there are no display utilities provided in this package.

## HTTP URL (Resource Names)

The HTTP protocol is designed to transfer content on Web. The requested content is specified by the Universal Resource Locator (URL). This is the primary component of every HTTP request. URLs always start with a *"/"* character and typically correspond to files on the HTTP Server. Common HTTP file extensions are shown below:

| Extension | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| .htm (or .html) | Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) |
| .txt | Plain ASCII text |
| .gif | Binary GIF image |
| .xbm | Binary Xbitmap image |

## HTTP Client Requests

The HTTP has a simple mechanism for requesting Web content. There is basically a set of standard HTTP commands that are issued by the Client after a connection has been successfully established on the TCP *well-known port 80*. The following shows some of the basic HTTP commands:

| HTTP Command | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| GET resource HTTP/1.0 | *Get the specified resource* |
| POST resource HTTP/1.0 | *Get the specified resource and pass attached input to the HTTP Serve* |
| HEAD resource HTTP/1.0 | *Treated like a GET but not content is returned by the HTTP Server* |
| PUT resource HTTP/1.0 | *Place resource on HTTP Server* |
| DELETE resource HTTP/1.0 | *Delete resource on the Server* |

These ASCII commands are generated internally by Web browsers and the NetX Duo HTTP Client services to perform HTTP operations with an HTTP Server.

> **Note:** The HTTP Client application default to the connect port of 80. However, it can change the connect port to the HTTP Server at runtime using the nx_http_client_set_connect_port service. See Chapter 4 for more details of this service. This is to accommodate web servers that occasionally use alternate ports for Client connections.

## HTTP Server Responses

The HTTP Server utilizes the same *well-known TCP port 80* to send Client command responses. Once the HTTP Server processes the Client command, it returns an ASCII response string that includes a 3-digit numeric status code. The numeric response is used by the HTTP Client software to determine whether the operation succeeded or failed. Following is a list of various HTTP Server responses to Client commands:

| Numeric Field | Meaning |
| ------------- | ------- |
| *200* | *Request was successful* |
| *400* |	*Request was not formed properly* |
| *401* | *Unauthorized request, client needs to send authentication* |
| *404* | *Specified resource in request was not found* |
| *500* | *Internal HTTP Server error* |
| *501* | *Request not implemented by HTTP Server* |
| *502* | *Service is not available* |

For example, a successful Client request to PUT the file "test.htm" is responded with the message "HTTP/1.0 200 OK."

## HTTP Communication

As mentioned previously, the HTTP Server utilizes the well-known TCP port 80 to field Client requests. HTTP Clients may use any available TCP port. The general sequence of HTTP events is as follows:

### HTTP GET Request:

1.	Client issues TCP connect to Server port 80.
2.	Client sends "**GET resource HTTP/1.0**" request (along with other header information).
3.	Server builds an "**HTTP/1.0 200 OK**" message with additional information followed immediately by the resource content (if any).
4.	Server performs a disconnection.
5.	Client performs a disconnection.

### HTTP PUT Request:

1.	Client issues TCP connect to Server port 80.
2.	Client sends "**PUT resource HTTP/1.0**" request, along with other header information, and followed by the resource content.
3.	Server builds an "**HTTP/1.0 200 OK**" message with additional information followed immediately by the resource content.
4.	Server performs a disconnection.
5.	Client performs a disconnection.

> **Note:** As mentioned previously, the HTTP Client can change the default connect port from 80 to another port using the *nx_http_client_set_connect_port* for web servers that use alternate ports to connect to clients.

## HTTP Authentication

HTTP authentication is optional and isn't required for all Web requests. There are two flavors of authentication, namely basic and digest. Basic authentication is equivalent to the name and password authentication found in many protocols. In HTTP basic authentication, the name and passwords are concatenated and encoded in the base64 format. The main disadvantage of basic authentication is the name and password are transmitted openly in the request. This makes it somewhat easy for the name and password to be stolen. Digest authentication addresses this problem by never transmitting the name and password in the request. Instead, an algorithm is used to derive a 128-bit key or digest from the name, password, and other information. The NetX Duo HTTP Server supports the standard MD5 digest algorithm.

When is authentication required? Basically, the HTTP Server decides if a requested resource requires authentication. If authentication is required and the Client request did not include the proper authentication, a "HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized" response with the type of authentication required is sent to the Client. The Client is then expected to form a new request with the proper authentication.

## HTTP Authentication Callback

As mentioned before, HTTP authentication is optional and isn't required on all Web transfers. In addition, authentication is typically resource dependent. Access of some resources on the Server require authentication, while others do not. The NetX Duo HTTP Server package allows the application to specify (via the *nx_http_server_create* call) an authentication callback routine that is called at the beginning of handling each HTTP Client request.

The callback routine provides the NetX Duo HTTP Server with the username, password, and realm strings associated with the resource and return the type of authentication necessary. If no authentication is necessary for the resource, the authentication callback should return the value of **NX_HTTP_DONT_AUTHENTICATE**. Otherwise, if basic authentication is required for the specified resource, the routine should return **NX_HTTP_BASIC_AUTHENTICATE**. And finally, if MD5 digest authentication is required, the callback routine should return **NX_HTTP_DIGEST_AUTHENTICATE**. If no authentication is required for any resource provided by the HTTP Server, the callback is not needed and a NULL pointer can be provided to the HTTP Server create call.

The format of the application authenticate callback routine is very simple and is defined below:

```c
UINT nx_http_server_authentication_check(NX_HTTP_SERVER *server_ptr,
                                          UINT request_type, CHAR *resource,
                                          CHAR **name, CHAR **password,
                                          CHAR **realm);
```
The input parameters are defined as follows:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --------- | --------|
| *request_type* | Specifies the HTTP Client request, valid requests are defined as: <br/> **NX_HTTP_SERVER_GET_REQUEST**<br/>**NX_HTTP_SERVER_POST_REQUEST**<br/>**NX_HTTP_SERVER_HEAD_REQUEST**<br/>**NX_HTTP_SERVER_PUT_REQUEST**<br/>**NX_HTTP_SERVER_DELETE_REQUEST** |
| *resource* | Specific resource requested. |
| *name* | Destination for the pointer to the required username. |
| *password* | Destination for the pointer to the required password. |
| *realm* | Destination for the pointer to the realm for this authentication. |

The return value of the authentication routine specifies if authentication is required. ```name, password, and realm``` pointers are not used if **NX_HTTP_DONT_AUTHENTICATE** is returned by the authentication callback routine. Otherwise the HTTP server developer must ensure that **NX_HTTP_MAX_USERNAME** and **NX_HTTP_MAX_PASSWORD** defined in *nxd_http_server.h* are large enough for the username and password specified in the authentication callback. These are both defaulted to size 20 chars.

## HTTP Invalid Username/Password Callback

The optional invalid username/password callback in NetX Duo HTTP Server is invoked if HTTP server receives an invalid username and password combination in a Client request. If the HTTP server application registers a callback with HTTP server it will be invoked if either basic or digest authentication fails in *nx_http_server_get_process*, in *nx_http_server_put_process*, or in *nx_http_server_delete_process*.

To register a callback with the HTTP server, the following service is defined in NetX Duo HTTP Server.

```c
UINT nx_http_server_invalid_userpassword_notify_set(
			       NX_HTTP_SERVER *http_server_ptr,
        		   UINT *invalid_username_password_callback)
                            (CHAR *resource,
                             NXD_ADDRESS *client_nxd_address,
                             UINT request_type))
```

The request types are defined as follows:
 - **NX_HTTP_SERVER_GET_REQUEST**
 - **NX_HTTP_SERVER_POST_REQUEST**
 - **NX_HTTP_SERVER_HEAD_REQUEST**
 - **NX_HTTP_SERVER_PUT_REQUEST**
 - **NX_HTTP_SERVER_DELETE_REQUEST**

## HTTP Insert GMT Date Header Callback

There is an optional callback in NetX Duo HTTP Server to insert a date header in its response messages. This callback is invoked when the HTTP Server is responding to a put or get request

There is an optional callback in NetX Duo HTTP Server to insert a date header in its response messages. This callback is invoked when the HTTP Server is responding to a put or get request

To register a GMT date callback with the HTTP server, the following service is defined in the NetX Duo HTTP Server.

```c
UINT  _nx_http_server_gmt_callback_set(
                    NX_HTTP_SERVER *server_ptr,
                   	VOID (*gmt_get)(NX_HTTP_SERVER_DATE *date)
```

The NX_HTTP_SERVER_DATE data type is defined as follows:

```c
typedef struct NX_HTTP_SERVER_DATE_STRUCT
{
    USHORT          nx_http_server_year;           /* Year                 */
    UCHAR           nx_http_server_month;          /* Month                */
    UCHAR           nx_http_server_day;            /* Day                  */
    UCHAR           nx_http_server_hour;           /* Hour       		*/
    UCHAR           nx_http_server_minute;         /* Minute               */
    UCHAR           nx_http_server_second;         /* Second               */
    UCHAR           nx_http_server_weekday;        /* Weekday              */
} NX_HTTP_SERVER_DATE;
```

## HTTP Cache Info Get Callback

The HTTP Server has a callback to request the max age and date from the HTTP application for a specific resource. This information is used to determine if the HTTP server sends the entire page in response to a Client Get request. If the "if modified since" in the Client request is not found or does not match the "last modified" date returned by the get cache callback, the entire page is sent.

To register the callback with the HTTP server the following service is defined:

```c
UINT  _nx_http_server_cache_info_callback_set(
                              NX_HTTP_SERVER *server_ptr,
                              UINT (*cache_info_get)
                                    (CHAR *, UINT *, NX_HTTP_SERVER_DATE *))
```

## HTTP Multipart Support

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) was originally intended for the SMTP protocol, but its use has spread to HTTP. MIME allows messages to contain mixed message types (e.g. image/jpg and text/plain) within the same message. NetX Duo HTTP Server has added services to determine content type in HTTP messages containing MIME from the Client. To enable HTTP multipart support and use these services, the configuration option **NX_HTTP_MULTIPART_ENABLE** must be defined.

```c
UINT  nx_http_server_get_entity_header(NX_HTTP_SERVER *server_ptr,
                                       NX_PACKET **packet_pptr,
                                       UCHAR *entity_header_buffer,
                                       ULONG buffer_size);

UINT  nx_http_server_get_entity_content(NX_HTTP_SERVER *server_ptr,
                                        NX_PACKET **packet_pptr,
                                        ULONG *available_offset,
                                        ULONG *available_length)
```

For more details on the use of these services, see their description in Chapter 3 "Description of HTTP Services".

## HTTP Multi-Thread Support

The NetX Duo HTTP Client services can be called from multiple threads simultaneously. However, read or write requests for a particular HTTP Client instance should be done in sequence from the same thread.

## HTTP RFCs

NetX Duo HTTP is compliant with RFC1945 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol/1.0, RFC 2581 "TCP Congestion Control", RFC 1122 "Requirements for Internet Hosts", and related RFCs.

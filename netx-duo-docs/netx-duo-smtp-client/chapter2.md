# Chapter 2 - Installation and use of NetX Duo SMTP client

This chapter contains a description of various issues related to installation, setup, and usage of the NetX Duo SMTP Client component.

## NetX Duo SMTP Client Installation

The NetX Duo SMTP Client is available at [https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo). The package includes the following files:

- **nxd_smtp_client.c** C Source file for NetX Duo SMTP Client API
- **nxd_smtp_client.h** C Header file for NetX Duo SMTP Client API
- **demo_netxduo_smtp_client.c** Demo for NetX Duo SMTP Client
- **nxd_smtp_client.pdf User Guide for** NetX Duo SMTP Client API

To use the NetX Duo SMTP Client API, the entire distribution mentioned previously may be copied to the same directory where NetX Duo is installed. For example, if NetX Duo is installed in the directory "c:*\myproject*" then the *nxd_smtp_client.h, and nxd_smtp_client.c* files should be copied into this directory.

## Using NetX Duo SMTP Client

To create the NetX Duo SMTP Client application, it must first build the ThreadX and NetX Duo libraries and include them in the build project. The application must then include tx*_api.h* and *nx_api.h in its application source code*. This will enable ThreadX and NetX Duo services. It must also include *nxd_smtp_client.c* and *nxd_smtp_client.h* after *tx_api.h* and *nx_api.h to use SMTP Client services.*

These files must be compiled in the same manner as other application files and the object code must be linked along with the files of the application. This is all that is required to create a NetX Duo SMTP Client application.

## Small Example System

An example of using the NetX Duo SMTP Client is described in Figure 1 that appears below. The packet pool for the IP instance is created using the nx_packet_pool_create service, on line 68 and has a very small packet payload. This is because the IP instance only sends control packets which don't require much payload. The SMTP Client packet pool created on line 84 and is used for transmitting SMTP Client messages to the server and message data. Its packet payload is much larger. The IP instance is created in line 118 using the same packet pool. TCP, required for the SMTP protocol, is enabled on the IP instance in line 130.

In the application thread, the SMTP Client is created using the *nxd_smtp_client_create* service, in line 170. The *nxd_smtp_client_create* service supports both IPv4 and IPv6 SMTP server connections although this example is limited to IPv4. Then the mail message is submitted to the SMTP Client for transmission on line 184 using the *nx_smtp_mail_send* service. Note that the subject line with the mail content header is created separately from the message body. Also note that the send mail request accepts only one recipient mail address which is assumed to be syntactically correct.

Then the application terminates the SMTP Client on line 200. The *nx_smtp_client_delete* service checks that the socket connection is closed and the port is unbound. Note that it is up to the SMTP Client application to delete the packet pool if it no longer has use for it.

   This is a small demo of the NetX Duo SMTP Client on the high-performance NetX
   Duo TCP/IP stack.  This demo relies on Thread, NetX Duo and SMTP Client API to
   perform simple SMTP mail transfers in an SMTP client application to an SMTP mail
   server.   */

## Client Configuration Options

There are several configuration options with the NetX Duo SMTP Client API. Following is a list of all options described in detail:

- **NX_SMTP_CLIENT_TCP_WINDOW_SIZE** This option sets the size of the Client TCP receive window. This should be set to below the MTU size of the underlying Ethernet hardware and allow room for IP and TCP headers. The default NetX Duo SMTP Client TCP window size is 1460.
- **NX_SMTP_CLIENT_PACKET_TIMEOUT** This option sets the timeout on NetX packet allocation. The default NetX Duo SMTP Client packet timeout is 2 seconds.
- **NX_SMTP_CLIENT_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT** This option sets the Client TCP socket connect timeout. The default NetX Duo SMTP Client connect timeout is 10 seconds.
- **NX_SMTP_CLIENT_DISCONNECT_TIMEOUT** This option sets the Client TCP socket disconnect timeout. The default NetX Duo SMTP Client disconnect timeout is 5 seconds*. Note that if the SMTP Client encounters an internal error such as a broken connection it may terminate the connection with a zero wait timeout.
- **NX_SMTP_GREETING_TIMEOUT** This option sets the timeout for the Client to receive the Server reply to its greeting. The default NetX Duo SMTP Client value is 10 seconds.
- **NX_SMTP_ENVELOPE_TIMEOUT** This option sets the timeout for the Client to receive the Server reply to a Client command. The default NetX Duo SMTP Client value is 10 seconds.
- **NX_SMTP_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT** This option sets the timeout for the Client to receive the Server reply to receiving the mail message data. The default NetX Duo SMTP Client value is 30 seconds.
- **NX_SMTP_CLIENT_SEND_TIMEOUT** This option defines the wait option of the buffer to store the user password during SMTP authentication with the Server. The default value is 20 bytes.
- **NX_SMTP_SERVER_CHALLENGE_MAX_STRING** This option defines the size of the buffer for extracting the Server challenge during SMTP authentication. The default value is 200 bytes. For LOGIN and PLAIN authentication, the SMTP Client can probably use a smaller buffer.
- **NX_SMTP_CLIENT_MAX_PASSWORD** This option defines the size of the buffer to store the user password during SMTP authentication with the Server. The default value is 20 bytes. 
- **NX_SMTP_CLIENT_MAX_USERNAME** This option defines the size of the buffer to store the host username during SMTP authentication with the Server. The default value is 40 bytes.

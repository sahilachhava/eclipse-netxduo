# Chapter 2 - Installation and use of NetX Duo Telnet

This chapter contains a description of various issues related to installation, setup, and usage of the NetX Duo Telnet component.

## Product Distribution

The NetX Duo Telnet package is available at <https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo>. The package includes the following files:

- **nxd_telnet_client.h**: Header file for Telnet Client for NetX Duo
- **nxd_telnet_client.c**: C Source file for Telnet Client for NetX Duo
- **nxd_telnet_server.h**: Header file for Telnet Server for NetX Duo
- **nxd_telnet_server.c**: C Source file for Telnet Server for NetX Duo
- **nxd_telnet.pdf**: PDF description of Telnet for NetX Duo
- **demo_netxduo_telnet.c**: NetX Duo Telnet demonstration

## Telnet Installation

In order to use Telnet for NetX Duo, the entire distribution mentioned previously should be copied to the same directory where NetX Duo is installed. For example, if NetX Duo is installed in the directory "*\threadx\arm7\green*" then the *nxd_telnet_client.h*, *nxd_telnet_client.c*, *nxd_telnet_server.c and nxd_telnet_server.h* files should be copied into this directory.

## Using Telnet

Using Telnet for NetX Duo is easy. Basically, the application code must include *nxd_telnet_server.h* for Telnet Server applications and *nxd_telnet_client.h* for Telnet Client applications after it includes *tx_api.h* and *nx_api.h*, in order to use ThreadX and NetX Duo. Once *the header* is included, the application code is then able to make the Telnet function calls specified later in this guide. The application must also include *nxd_telnet_client.c* and *nxd_telnet_server.c* in the build process. These files must be compiled in the same manner as other application files and its object form must be linked along with the files of the application. This is all that is required to use NetX Duo Telnet.

If no Telnet Client capabilities are required, the *nxd_telnet_client.c* file may be omitted.

Note also that because Telnet utilizes NetX Duo TCP services, TCP must be enabled with the *nx_tcp_enable* call prior to using Telnet.

## Small Example System

An example of how to use NetX Duo Telnet is shown below. In this example, the Telnet include files *are* brought in at line 7 and 8. Next, the Telnet Server is created in “*tx_application_define*” at line 146. Note that the Telnet Server and Client control blocks are defined as global variables at line 23-24 previously.

Before the Telnet Server or Client can be started they must validate their IP address with NetX Duo. For IPv4 connections this is accomplished by simply waiting briefly to let the NetX Duo driver initialize the system on line 166. For IPv6 connections, this requires enabling IPv6 and ICMPv6 which it does in lines 171-172. The Client sets its global and link local IPv6 addresses on the primary interface on lines 181-186 and waits for NetX Duo validation to complete in the background. The Server also sets its global and link local addresses on its primary interface in lines 192 – 198. Note that the two services, *nxd_ipv6_global_address_set* and *nxd_ipv6_linklocal_address_set* are replaced with *nxd_ipv6_address_set service*. The former two services are still available for legacy NetX applications but are eventually deprecated. Developers are encouraged to use *nxd_ipv6_address_set* instead.

After successful IP address validation with NetX Duo, the Telnet Server is started at line 215 using the *nxd_telnet_server_start* service. At line 226 the Telnet Client is created using the *nx_telnet_client_create* service. It then connects with the Telnet Server on line 242 for IPv4 applications and line 238 for IPv6 applications using the *nxd_telnet_client_connect* and *nx_telnet_client_connect* services respectively. After successful validation and connection with the server, it makes a few exchanges before disconnecting.

## Configuration Options

There are several configuration options for building Telnet for NetX Duo. These #defines can be set by the application prior to inclusion of *nxd_telnet_server.h*.and *nxd_telnet_client.h.*

Following is a list of all options, where each is described in detail:  
  
- **NX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING**: Defined, this option removes the basic Telnet error checking. It is typically used after the application has been debugged.
- **NX_TELNET_MAX_CLIENTS**: The maximum number of Telnet Clients supported by the Server thread. By default, this value is defined as 4 to specify a maximum of 4 clients at a time.
- **NX_TELNET_SERVER_PRIORITY**: The priority of the Telnet Server thread. By default, this value is defined as 16 to specify priority 16.
- **NX_TELNET_TOS**: Type of service required for the Telnet TCP requests. By default, this value is defined as NX_IP_NORMAL to indicate  
normal IP packet service.
- **NX_TELNET_FRAGMENT_OPTION**: Fragment enable for Telnet TCP requests. By default, this value is NX_DONT_FRAGMENT to disable Telnet TCP fragmenting.
- **NX_TELNET_SERVER_WINDOW_SIZE**: Server socket window size. By default, this value is 2048 bytes.
- **NX_TELNET_TIME_TO_LIVE**: Specifies the number of routers this packet can pass before it is discarded. The default value is set to 0x80.
- **NX_TELNET_SERVER_TIMEOUT**: Specifies the number of ThreadX ticks that internal services will suspend for. The default value is set to 10 seconds.
- **NX_TELNET_ACTIVITY_TIMEOUT**: Specifies the number of seconds that can elapse without any activity before the Server disconnects the Client connection. The default value is set to 600 seconds.
- **NX_TELNET_TIMEOUT_PERIOD**: Specifies the number of seconds between checking for Client activity timeouts. The default value is set to 60 seconds.
- **NX_TELNET_SERVER_OPTION_DISABLE**: Defined, Telnet option negotiation is disabled. By default this option is not defined.
- **NX_TELNET_SERVER_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL**: If defined, the Telnet Server packet pool must be created externally. This is only meaningful if NX_TELNET_SERVER_OPTION_DISABLE is not defined. By default this option is not defined and the Telnet Server thread creates its own packet pool.
- **NX_TELNET_SERVER_PACKET_PAYLOAD**: Defines the size of the packet payload created by the Telnet Server for option negotiation. Note that the Telnet Server only creates this packet pool if NX_TELNET_SERVER _OPTION_DISABLE is not defined (Telnet options are enabled). The default value of this option is 300.
- **NX_TELNET_SERVER_PACKET_POOL_SIZE**: Defines the size of the Telnet Server packet pool used for Telnet negotiations. Note that the Telnet Server only creates this packet pool if NX_TELNET_SERVER _OPTION_DISABLE is not defined (Telnet options are enabled). The default value of this option is 2048 (\~5-6 packets).

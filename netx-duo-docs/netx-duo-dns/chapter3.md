# Chapter 3 - Description of NetX Duo DNS Client Services

This chapter contains a description of all NetX Duo DNS services (listed below) in alphabetic order.

In the **Return Values** section in the following API descriptions, values in **BOLD** are not affected by the **NX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING** define that is used to disable API error checking, while non-bold values are completely disabled.

## nx_dns_authority_zone_start_get

Look up the start of the zone of authority for the input host

### Prototype
```C
UINT nx_dns_authority_zone_start_get (
    NX_DNS *dns_ptr, UCHAR *host_name, 
    VOID *record_buffer,                                        
    UINT buffer_size, 
    UINT *record_count, 
    ULONG wait_option);
```
### Description

If **NX_DNS_ENABLE_EXTENDED_RR_TYPES** is defined, this service sends a query of type SOA with the specified domain name to obtain the start of the zone of authority for the input domain name. The DNS Client copies the SOA record(s) returned in the DNS Server response into the *record_buffer* memory location.

> **Note:** The *record_buffer* must be 4-byte aligned to receive the data.

In NetX Duo DNS Client, the SOA record type, NX_DNS_SOA_ENTRY, is saved as seven 4 byte parameters, totaling 28 bytes:

- *nx_dns_soa_host_mname_ptr*: Pointer to primary source of data for this zone.
- *nx_dns_soa_host_rname_ptr*: Pointer to mailbox responsible for this zone
- *nx_dns_soa_serial*: Zone version number
- *nx_dns_soa_refresh*: Refresh interval
- *nx_dns_soa_retry*: Interval between SOA query retries
- *nx_dns_soa_expire*: Time duration when SOA expires
- *nx_dns_soa_minmum*: Minimum TTL field in SOA hostname DNS reply messages

The storage of a two SOA records is shown below. The SOA records containing fixed length data are entered starting at the top of the buffer. The pointers MNAME and RNAME point to the variable length data (host names) which are stored at the bottom of the buffer. Additional SOA records are entered after the first record ("additional SOA recordsâ€¦") and their variable length data is stored above the last entry's variable length data ("additional SOA variable length data"):

![The storage of a two SOA records](media/image4.png)

If the input *record_buffer* cannot hold all the SOA data in the server reply, the the *record_buffer* holds as many records as will fit and returns the number of records in the buffer.

With the number of SOA records returned in **record_count,* the application can parse the data from *record_buffer* and extract the start of zone authority host name strings.

### Input Parameters

- *dns_ptr*: Pointer to DNS Client.  
- *host_name*: Pointer to host name to obtain SOA data for
- *record_buffer*: Pointer to location to extract SOA data into
- *buffer_size*: Size of buffer to hold SOA data
- *record_count*: Pointer to the number of SOA records retrieved
- *wait_option*: Wait option to receive DNS Server response

### Return Values

- **NX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successfully obtained SOA data
- **NX_DNS_NO_SERVER** (0xA1) Client server list is empty
- **NX_DNS_QUERY_FAILED** (0xA3) No valid DNS response received
- NX_PTR_ERROR (0x07) Invalid IP or DNS pointer

##  nx_dns_create

Create a DNS Client instance

### Prototype
```C
UINT nx_dns_create(
    NX_DNS *dns_ptr,
    NX_IP *ip_ptr,
    CHAR *domain_name);
```
### Description

This service creates a DNS Client instance for the previously created IP instance.

> **Important:** The application must ensure that the packet payload of the packet pool used by the DNS Client is large enough for the maximum 512 byte DNS message, plus UDP, IP and Ethernet headers. If the DNS Client creates its own packet pool, this is defined by **NX_DNS_PACKET_PAYLOAD** and **NX_DNS_PACKET_POOL_SIZE**.

If the DNS Client application prefers to supply a previously created packet pool, the payload for IPv4 DNS Client should be 512 bytes for the maximum DNS plus 20 bytes for the IP header, 8 bytes for the UDP header and 14 bytes for the Ethernet header. For IPv6 the only difference is the IP header is 40 bytes, therefore the packet needs to accommodate the IPv6 header of 40 bytes.

### Input Parameters

- *dns_ptr*: Pointer to DNS Client.  
- *ip_ptr*: Pointer to previously created IP instance.  
- *domain_name*: Pointer to domain name for DNS instance.

### Return Values

- **NX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful DNS create
- **NX_DNS_ERROR** (0xA0) DNS create error
- NX_PTR_ERROR (0x07) Invalid IP or DNS pointer
- NX_CALLER_ERROR (0x11) Invalid caller of this service

### Allowed From

Threads

### Example
```C
/* Create a DNS Client instance. */
status =  nx_dns_create(&my_dns, &my_ip, "My DNS");

/* If status is NX_SUCCESS a DNS Client instance was successfully
   created. */
```

## nx_dns_delete

Delete a DNS Client instance

### Prototype
```C
UINT nx_dns_delete(NX_DNS *dns_ptr);
```
### Description

This service deletes a previously created DNS Client instance and frees up its resources.

> **Note:** If NX_DNS_CLIENT_USER_CREATE_PACKET_POOL is defined and the DNS Client was assigned a user defined packet pool, it is up to the application to delete the DNS Client packet pool if it no longer needs it.

### Input Parameters

- *dns_ptr*: Pointer to previously created DNS Client instance.

### Return Values

- **NX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful DNS Client delete.
- NX_PTR_ERROR (0x07) Invalid IP or DNS Client pointer.
- NX_CALLER_ERROR (0x11) Invalid caller of this service.

### Allowed From

Threads

### Example
```C
/* Delete a DNS Client instance. */
status =  nx_dns_delete(&my_dns);

/* If status is NX_SUCCESS the DNS Client instance was successfully
   deleted. */
```

## nx_dns_domain_name_server_get

Look up the authoritative name servers for the input domain zone

### Prototype
```C
UINT nx_dns_domain_name_server_get(
    NX_DNS *dns_ptr,
    UCHAR *host_name, 
    VOID *record_buffer,
    UINT buffer_size, 
    UINT *record_count,
    ULONG wait_option);
```

### Description

If NX_DNS_ENABLE_EXTENDED_RR_TYPES is defined, this service sends a query of type NS with the specified domain name to obtain the name servers for the input domain name. The DNS Client copies the NS record(s) returned in the DNS Server response into the *record_buffer* memory location.

> **Note:** The *record_buffer* must be 4-byte aligned to receive the data.

In NetX Duo DNS Client the NS data type, NX_DNS_NS_ENTRY, is saved as two 4-byte parameters:

- *nx_dns_ns_ipv4_address*: Name server's IPv4 address
- *nx_dns_ns_hostname_ptr*: Pointer to the name server's hostname

The buffer shown below contains four NX_DNS_NS_ENTRY records. The pointer to host name string in each entry points to the corresponding host name string in the bottom half of the buffer:

![Contains four NX_DNS_NS_ENTRY records](media/image5.png)

If the input *record_buffer* cannot hold all the NS data in the server reply, the the *record_buffer* holds as many records as will fit and returns the number of records in the buffer.

With the number of NS records returned in **record_count,* the application can parse the IP address and host name of each record in the *record_buffer*.

### Input Parameters

## nx_dns_domain_service_get

Look up the service(s) provided by the input host name

### Prototype
```C
UINT nx_dns_domain_service_get (
    NX_DNS *dns_ptr,
    UCHAR *host_name, 
    VOID *record_buffer,
    UINT buffer_size, 
    UINT *record_count,
    ULONG wait_option);
```

### Description

If **NX_DNS_ENABLE_EXTENDED_RR_TYPES** is defined, this service sends a query of type SRV with the specified domain name to look up the service(s) and their port number associated with the specified domain. The DNS Client copies the SRV record(s) returned in the DNS Server response into the *record_buffer* memory location.

> **Note:** The *record_buffer* must be 4-byte aligned to receive the data.

In NetX Duo DNS Client, the service record type, **NX_DNS_SRV_ENTRY**, is saved as six parameters, totaling 16 bytes. This enables variable length SRV data to be stored in a memory efficient manner:

- *Server IPv4 address*: nx_dns_srv_ipv4_address 4 bytes
- *Server priority*: nx_dns_srv_priority 2 bytes
- *Server weight*: nx_dns_srv_weight 2 bytes
- *Service port number*: nx_dns_srv_port_number 2 bytes
- *Reserved for 4-byte alignment*: nx_dns_srv_reserved0 2 bytes
- *Pointer to server host name*: *nx_dns_srv_hostname_ptr 4 bytes

Four SRV records are stored in the supplied buffer. Each NX_DNS_SRV_ENTRY record contains a pointer, *nx_dns_srv_hostname_ptr*, that points to the corresponding host name string in the bottom of the record buffer:

![Four SRV records](media/image7.png)

If the input *record_buffer* cannot hold all the SRV data in the server reply, the the *record_buffer* holds as many records as will fit and returns the number of records in the buffer.

With the number of SRV records returned in **record_count,* the application can parse the SRV parameters, including the server host name of each record in the *record_buffer*.

### Input Parameters

- *dns_ptr*: Pointer to DNS Client.  
- *host_name*: Pointer to host name to obtain SRV data for
- *record_buffer*: Pointer to location to extract SRV data into
- *buffer_size*: Size of buffer to hold SRV data
- *record_count*: Pointer to the number of SRV records retrieved
- *wait_option*: Wait option to receive DNS Server response

### Return Values

- **NX_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successfully obtained SRV data
- **NX_DNS_NO_SERVER** (0xA1) Client server list is empty
- **NX_DNS_QUERY_FAILED** (0xA3) No valid DNS response received

    UCHAR *host_name_ptr,
    VOID *buffer, 
    UINT buffer_size, 
    UINT *record_count, 
    ULONG wait_option);
```

### Description

This service sends a query of Type A with the specified host name to obtain the IP addresses for the input host name. The DNS Client copies the IPv4 address from the A record(s) returned in the DNS Server response into the *record_buffer* memory location.

> **Note:** The *record_buffer* must be 4-byte aligned to receive the data.

Multiple IPv4 addresses are stored in the 4-byte aligned buffer as shown below:

![multiple address 4-byte aligned buffer](media/image8.png)

If the supplied buffer cannot hold all the IP address data, the remaining A records are not stored in *record_buffer*. This enables the application to retrieve one, some or all of the available IP address data in the server reply.

With the number of A records returned in **record_count* the application can parse the IPv4 address data from the *record_buffer*.

### Input Parameters

- *dns_ptr*: Pointer to DNS Client.  
- *host_name_ptr*: Pointer to host name to obtain IPv4 address
- *buffer*: Pointer to location to extract IPv4 data into
- *buffer_size*: Size of buffer to hold IPv4 data

    UINT *record_count, 
    ULONG wait_option);
```

### Description

This service sends a query of type AAAA with the specified domain name to obtain the IP addresses for the input domain name. The DNS Client copies the IPv6 address from the AAAA record(s) returned in the DNS Server response into the *record_buffer* memory location. 

> **Note:** The *record_buffer* must be 4-byte aligned to receive the data.

The format of IPv6 addresses stored in the 4-byte aligned buffer is shown below:

![IPv6 format 4-byte aligned buffer](media/image9.png)

If the input *record_buffer* cannot hold all the AAAA data in the server reply, the the *record_buffer* holds as many records as will fit and returns the number of records in the buffer.

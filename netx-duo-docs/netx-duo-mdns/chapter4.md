### Allowed From

Threads

### Example

```C
UCHAR stack_ptr[2048];
UCHAR local_cache_ptr[2048];
UCHAR peer_cache_ptr[8192];

/* Create a mDNS instance. */
status = nx_mdns_create(&my_mdns, &ip_0, &pool_0,
    3, stack_ptr, 2048,

### Prototype

```C
UINT nx_mdns_enable(
    NX_MDNS *mdns_ptr,
    UINT interface_index);

/* If status is NX_SUCCESS, mDNS service was enabled. */
```

## nx_mdns_disable

Disable the mDNS service

### Prototype

```C
UINT nx_mdns_disable(
    NX_MDNS *mdns_ptr,
    UINT interface_index);
```

### Description

This API disables mDNS service on the specific physical interface. Once the service is disabled, the mDNS sends "goodbye" messages for every local service to the network that is attached to the interface, so the neighboring nodes are notified.

        UINT state,
        UINT cache_type));
```

### Description

This service installs a user-supplied callback function, which is invoked when either the local service cache or peer service cache becomes full. When the service cache is full, no more mDNS Resource Record can be added. Note that the service cache may become full as a result of internal fragmentation, when services with various string lengths are added and removed. On receiving a cache full notification on peer service cache, the application may use the service "*nx_mdns_service_cache_clear"* to erase all entries in the peer service cache.

Publish period starts from *t* ticks and can be expanded telescopically with 2 to the power of *k* factor. The number of repetitions per advertisement is *p*, the interval between each repeated advertisement is *interval* ticks, and the number of announcement period is max_time. By default, the initial period is set to 1 second, with k = 1 (the period doubles each time), *p = 1* (no repetition), retrans_interval = 0(no time interval), period_interval = 0xFFFFFFFF(max period interval) and max_time = 3(number of advertisement).

### Input Parameters

```

### Description

This API registers a service offered by the application. If the flag *is_unique* is set, mDNS probes the service name to make sure it is unique on the local network before starting to announce the service on the network. *Instance* is the instance portion of the service name. The *service* is the service portion of the service name. For example "_http._tcp" is a service. To describe a service with subtype, caller must use the *subtype* parameter.

### Input Parameters

- *mdns_ptr*: Pointer to mDNS control block.
- *instance*: Pointer to the instance name of the service.

- *priority*: Service priority
- *weight*: Service weight
- *port*: TCP or UDP port number the service uses
- *text*: Additional text information
- *is_unique*: Boolean flag indicating whether the service is shared or unique. For services registered as unique, mDNS must probe the service on the network before starting offering it.
- *interface_index*: Physical interface the service is offered through. For a service that is offered through any of the attached services, the value *NX_MDNS_ALL_INTERFACES* is used.

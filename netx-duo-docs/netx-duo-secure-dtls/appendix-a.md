# Appendix A: NetX Duo Secure DTLS return/error codes

## NetX Duo Secure TLS/DTLS return codes

Table 1 below lists the possible error codes that may be returned by NetX Duo Secure DTLS services. Note that the services may also return UDP or IP error codes â€“ TLS values begin at 0x101 and TCP/IP/UDP values are below 0x100. X.509 return values start at 0x181. Refer to the NetX Duo TCP/IP/UDP documentation for information on IP and UDP return values and see below for X.509 values.

## NetX Duo Secure X.509 Return Codes

Table 2 below lists the possible error codes that may be returned by NetX Duo Secure X.509 services. Note that the services may also return other error codes. X.509 return values start at 0x181, TLS values begin at 0x101, and TCP/IP values are below 0x100. Refer to the NetX Duo TCP/IP documentation for information on TCP/IP return values and above for TLS return values.

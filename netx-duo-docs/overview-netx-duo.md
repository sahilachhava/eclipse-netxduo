Eclipse ThreadX provides OEMs with components to secure communication and to create code and data isolation using underlying MCU/MPU hardware protection mechanisms. It is ultimately the responsibility of the device builder to ensure the device fully meets the evolving security requirements associated with its specific use case.

## Interoperability verification

NetX Duo conforms to RFC standards and offers complete interoperability with devices for most vendors.

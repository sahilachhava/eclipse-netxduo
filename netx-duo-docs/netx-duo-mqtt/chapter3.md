    UINT server_port,
    UINT keepalive, UINT clean_session,
    ULONG wait_option));
```

### Description

This service initiates a connection to the broker. First it binds a TCP socket, then makes a TCP connection. Assuming that succeeds, it creates a timer if the MQTT keep alive feature is enabled. Then it connects with the MQTT server (broker).

Note that this service creates an MQTT connection with no TLS protection. To create a secure MQTT connection, the application shall use the service ***nxd_mqtt_client_secure_connect.***

Upon the connection, if the client sets the *clean_session* to NX_FALSE, the client will retransmit any messages stored that have not been acknowledged yet.

### Input Parameters

- *client_ptr*: Pointer to MQTT Client control block.
- *server_ip*: Broker IP address.
- *server_port*: Broker port number. The default port for MQTT is defined as **NXD_MQTT_PORT** (1883).
- *keep_alive*: The keep alive value, in seconds, to be used during the session. The value indicates the maximum time between two MQTT control messages being sent to the broker before the broker times out this client. The value 0 turns off the keep-alive feature.
- *clean_session*: Whether the server shall start this session clean. Valid options are **NX_TRUE** or **NX_FALSE.**
- *wait_option*: Connection wait time.

### Return Values

- **NXD_MQTT_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful MQTT connection
- **NXD_MQTT_ALREADY_CONNECTED** (0x10001) The client is already connected to the broker.
- **NXD_MQTT_MUTEX_FAILURE** (0x10003) Failed to obtain MQTT mutex

/* Create the MQTT Client instance "my_client" on "ip_0". */
status = nxd_mqtt_client_connect(&my_client, &broker_address,
    NXD_MQTT_PORT,
    0, /* Turn off keepalive */
    NX_TRUE, /* Clean session flag set */
    NX_WAIT_FOREVER);

### Prototype

```c
UINT nxd_mqtt_client_secure_connect(
    NXD_MQTT_CLIENT *client_ptr,
    NXD_ADDRESS *server_ip,
    UINT server_port,
    UINT (*tls_setup)(
        NXD_MQTT_CLIENT *,
        NX_SECURE_TLS_SESSION *,
        NX_SECURE_TLS_CERTIFICATE *,
        NX_SECURE_TLS_CERTIFICATE *),
    UINT keepalive,
    UINT connection_flag,
    UINT clean_session,
    ULONG wait_option));
```

### Description

This service is identical to ***nxd_mqtt_client_connect*** except that the connection goes through TLS layer instead of TCP. Therefore, communication between the client and the broker is secured.

The user-defined *tls_setup* is a callback function that the MQTT client uses prior to making a MQTT client connection. The application shall initialize NetX Duo Secure TLS, configure security parameters, and load relevant certificates to be used during TLS handshake. The actual TLS handshake happens after a TCP connection is established on the broker's MQTT TLS port (default TCP port 8883). Once the TLS handshake is successful, the MQTT CONNECT control packet is sent via TLS.

To make secure connections, the NetX Duo Secure TLS library must be available, and the NetX Duo MQTT client must be built with **NX_SECURE_ENABLE** defined.

### Input Parameters

- *client_ptr*: Pointer to MQTT Client control block.
- *server_ip*: Broker IP address.
- *server_port*: Broker port number. The default port for MQTT is defined as **NXD_MQTT_TLS_PORT**: (8883).
- *tls_setup*: User-provided TLS Setup callback function. This callback function is invoked to set up TLS client connection parameters.
- *keep_alive*: The keep-alive value to be used during the session. The value 0 turns off the keep-alive feature.
- *clean_session*: Whether or not the server shall start this session clean. Valid options are **NX_TRUE** or **NX_FALSE.**
- *wait_option*: Connection wait time.

### Return Values

- **NXD_MQTT_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successful MQTT client connection established via TLS.
- **NXD_MQTT_ALREADY_CONNECTED** (0x10001) The client is already connected to the broker.
- **NXD_MQTT_MUTEX_FAILURE** (0x10003) Failed to obtain MQTT mutex

    UINT *actual_topic_length,
    UCHAR *message_buffer,
    UINT message_buffer_size,
    UINT *actual_message_length);
```

### Description

This service retrieves a message published by the broker. All incoming messages are stored in the receive queue. The application uses this service to retrieve these messages. This call is non-blocking. If the receive queue is empty, this service returns **NXD_MQTT_NO_MESSAGE**. An application wishing to be notified of incoming message can call the service ***nxd_mqtt_client_receive_notify_set*** to register a receive callback function.

The caller needs to provide memory space for the topic string and the message body. The sizes of these two buffers are passed in using *topic_buffer_size* and *message_buffer_size*. The actual number of bytes in the topic string and the message body are returned in *actual_topic_length* and *actual_message_length*. If topic length or massage length is greater than the buffer space provided, this service returns error code *NXD_MQTT_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER_SIZE*.

The application shall allocate a bigger buffer and try again.

### Input Parameters

- *client_ptr*: Pointer to MQTT Client control block.
- *topic_buffer*: Pointer to the memory location where the topic string
is copied into.
- *topic_buffer_size*: Size of the topic buffer.
- *actual_topic_length*: Pointer to the memory location where the actual topic length is returned.
- *message_buffer*: Pointer to the memory location where the message string is copied into.
- *message_buffer_size*: Size of the message buffer.

### Prototype

```c
UINT nxd_mqtt_client_disconnect_notify_set(
    NXD_MQTT_CLIENT *client_ptr,
    VOID(*disconnect_notify)(NXD_MQTT_CLIENT* client_ptr));
```

### Description

This service registers a callback function with the MQTT client. When MQTT detects the connection to the broker is lost, it calls this notify function to alert the application. Therefore, the application can use this callback function to detect a lost connection, and to be able to re-establish connection to the broker.

```c
VOID callback_func(NXD_MQTT_CLIENT *client_ptr);
```

### Input Parameters

- *client_ptr*: Pointer to MQTT Client control block.
- *disconnect_notify*: User supplied callback function to be invoked when MQTT detects the connection to the broker is lost.

    disconnect_notify);
```

## nxd_mqtt_client_disconnect

Disconnect MQTT client from the broker

### Prototype

```c
UINT nxd_mqtt_client_disconnect(NXD_MQTT_CLIENT *client_ptr);
```

### Description

This service disconnects the client from the broker. Note that messages on the receive queue are released. Messages with QoS 1 in the transmit queue are not released. After the client reconnects to the server, QoS 1 messages can be processed, unless the client reconnects to the server with *clean_session* flag set to **NX_TRUE**.

If the connection was made with TLS security protection, this service will close the TLS session before disconnecting the TCP connection.

The actual TCP socket disconnect call has a wait option defined by NXD_MQTT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT (timer ticks). The default value is NX_WAIT_FOREVER. To avoid indefinite suspension in the event that the network connection is lost or the server is not responding, set this option to a finite value.

### Input Parameters

- *client_ptr*: Pointer to MQTT Client control block.

### Return Values

- **NXD_MQTT_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successfully disconnected from broker
- **NXD_MQTT_MUTEX_FAILURE** (0x10003) Failed to obtain MQTT mutex.
- NX_PTR_ERROR (0x07) Invalid MQTT control block

### Allowed From

Threads

### Example

```c
/* Disconnect from the broker. */
status = nxd_mqtt_client_disconnect(&my_client);

/* If status is NXD_MQTT_SUCCESS the client is successfully
disconnected from the broker. */
```

## nxd_mqtt_client_delete

Delete the MQTT client instance

### Prototype

```c
UINT nxd_mqtt_client_delete(NXD_MQTT_CLIENT *client_ptr);
```

### Description

This service deletes the MQTT client instance and releases internal resources. This service automatically disconnects the client from the broker if it is still connected. Messages not yet transmitted or not been acknowledged are released. Messages received but not retrieved by the application are also released.

If the connection was made with TLS security protection, this service closes the TLS session before disconnecting the TCP connection.

After the client is deleted, an application wishing to use MQTT service needs to create a new instance.

### Input Parameters

- *client_ptr*: Pointer to MQTT Client control block.

### Return Values

- **NXD_MQTT_SUCCESS** (0x00) Successfully deleted MQTT client.
- NX_PTR_ERROR (0x07) Invalid MQTT control block

### Allowed From

Threads

### Example

```c
/* Delete the MQTT client instance. */
status = nxd_mqtt_client_delete(&my_client);

/* If status is NXD_MQTT_SUCCESS the client is successfully
deleted from the system. */
```

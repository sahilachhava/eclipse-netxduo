# Chapter 2 - Installation and use of NetX Duo MQTT client

This chapter contains a description of various issues related to installation, setup, and usage of the NetX Duo MQTT client component.

## Product Distribution

MQTT Client for NetX Duo is available at [https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo). The package includes two source files, one include file, and a file that contains this document, as follows:

- **nxd_mqtt_client.h** Header file for MQTT Client for NetX Duo
- **nxd_mqtt_client.c** C Source file for MQTT Client for NetX Duo
- **nxd_mqtt_client.pdf** Description of MQTT Client for NetX Duo
- **demo_mqtt_client.c** NetX Duo MQTT demonstration

## MQTT Client Installation

In order to use MQTT Client for NetX Duo, the entire distribution mentioned previously should be copied to the same directory where NetX Duo is installed. For example, if NetX Duo is installed in the directory "*\threadx\arm7\green*" then the *nxd_mqtt_client.h* and *nxd_mqtt_client.c* for NetX Duo MQTT Client need to be copied into this directory.

## Using MQTT Client

Using MQTT Client for NetX Duo is easy. Basically, the application code must include *nxd_mqtt_client.h* after it includes *tx_api.h* and *nx_api.h*, in order to use ThreadX, and NetX Duo, respectively. Once the MQTT Client header files are included, the application code is then able to use the MQTT services described later in this guide. The application must also include *nxd_mqtt_client.c* in the build process. These files must be compiled in the same manner as other application files and its object form must be linked along with the files of the application. This is all that is required to use NetX Duo MQTT Client.

## Using MQTT Client with NetX Duo Secure TLS

To use MQTT client with NetX Duo Secure TLS module, application must have NetX Duo Secure TLS module installed, and include *nx_secure_tls_api.h* and *nx_crypto.h*. The MQTT library must be built with the symbol ***NX_SECURE_ENABLE*** defined.

## Configuration Options

There are several configuration options for building MQTT client for NetX Duo. Following is a list of all options, where each is described in detail. The default values are listed, but can be redefined prior to inclusion of *nxd_mqtt_client.h.*

- **NX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING**: Defined, this option removes the
basic MQTT client error checking. It is typically used after the
application has been debugged.
- **NX_SECURE_ENABLE**: Defined, MQTT Client is built with TLS support.
Defining this symbol requires NetX Duo Secure TLS module to be installed.
*NX_SECURE_ENABLE* is not enabled by default.**
- **NXD_MQTT_REQUIRE_TLS**: Defined, application must use TLS to
connect to MQTT broker. This feature requires *NX_SECURE_ENABLE*
defined. By default, this symbol is not defined.
- **NXD_MQTT_MAXIMUM_TRANSMIT_QUEUE_DEPTH**: Defined, MQTT transmit queue depth is enabled. It must be positive integer.
- **NXD_MQTT_MAX_TOPIC_NAME_LENGTH**: Deprecated.
- **NXD_MQTT_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH**: Deprecated.
- **NXD_MQTT_KEEPALIVE_TIMER_RATE**: Defines the MQTT timer rate, in ThreadX timer ticks. This timer is used to keep track of the time since last MQTT control message was sent, and sends out an MQTT PINGREQ message before the keep-alive time expires. This timer is activated if the client connects to the broker with a keep-alive timer value set. The default value is TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND, which is a one-second timer.
- **NXD_MQTT_PING_TIMEOUT_DELAY**: Defines the time the MQTT client waits for PINGRESP from the broker after it sends out MQTT PINGREQ. If no PINGRESP is received after this timeout delay, the client treats the broker as non-responsive and disconnects itself from the broker. The default PING timeout delay is TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND, which is one second.
- **NXD_MQTT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT**: Defines the time out in the TCP socket disconnect call when disconnecting from the MQTT server in timer ticks. The default value is NX_WAIT_FOREVER.

## Sample MQTT program

The following program illustrates a simple MQTT application. For simplicity, the return codes are assumed to be successful, therefore no further error checking is done.

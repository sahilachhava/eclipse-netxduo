# Chapter 2 - Installation and use of NAT

This chapter contains a description how to install, set up, and use the NetX Duo NAT services.

## NetX Duo NAT Installation

NetX Duo NAT is available at [https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo](https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo). The NetX Duo NAT package includes one source file and one header file, a demonstration application file, and a PDF file for this document, as follows:

- **nx_nat.c** C Source file for NetX Duo NAT
- **nx_nat.h** C Header file for NetX Duo NAT
- **demo_netx_nat.c** Example host NetX Duo C source file
- **nx_nat.docx** Description of the NetX Duo NAT User Guide (this document)

Copy the NetX Duo NAT source code files to the same directory where NetX Duo and ThreadX are installed. For example, if NetX Duo and ThreadX are installed in the directory "*\threadx\mcf5485\green*" then *nx_nat.c*, *nx_nat.h and the modified NetX Duo files* should be copied into this directory. Copy the modified NetX Duo files over the existing NetX Duo files. Copy the Ethernet controller driver files into this directory as well.

To build a NetX Duo NAT application:

- The NetX Duo library *nxduo.a* must be built with NX_NAT_ENABLED defined. This can be done in *nx_user.h*, (make sure NX_INCLUDE_USER_DEFINE_FILE is also defined to ensure that configuration options in *nx_user.h* are included in the build.
- The application project must include *nx_nat.h* after *tx_api.h* and *nx_api.h. The latter two header files are necessary* to use ThreadX and NetX Duo services.
- The application then enables NAT on a previously created IP instance using the *nx_nat_enable* service.
- The application code can dynamically enable/disable NAT by calling the *nx_nat_enable* and *nx_nat_disable* service.
- The application project code is compiled and linked with the NAT enabled NetX Duo library to create the executable.
- To support NAT connections using TCP, UDP or ICMP protocols, NetX Duo must be enabled to support that protocol. This is done by calling *nx_tcp_enable, nx_udp_enable* and *nx_icmp_enable* for the previously created IP instance respectively.

## Small Example Demo NAT Setup

An example of how an application sets up NetX Duo NAT is shown in the *tx_application_define* function in Figure 4 below. Unlike most NetX Duo demo files distributed on the installation CD, this demo runs on an actual processor board with two Ethernet controllers, instead of a Windows PC using the virtual network driver *_nx_ram_network_driver*(). The NAT device is connected to the local domain through a local switch on its local interface, and to the external network through second switch on its external interface.

NetX Duo basic configuration is shown in demo_netx_nat.c. The private network is defined as 192.168.2.xx and has two local host nodes. The global network is defined as 192.168.0.xx and defines its gateway for out of network packets as 192.168.0.1. The NetX Duo IP instances are created on lines 118-171 and invoke the 'ram' driver; nat_ip instance attached two interfaces act as an NAT router, local_ip instance attached on interface act as local host; external_ip instance attached one interface act as external host.

The NAT is created in line 252 and invokes the cache to store dynamic translation entries. Enable the NAT feature in line319, static translation entrie (inbound entry) is created in lines 362 to allow external host to access to local host.

```C
/*
   demo_netx_nat.c

   This is a small demo of NAT (Network Address Translation) on the high-performance
   NetX TCP/IP stack.  This demo relies on ThreadX, NetX and NAT APIs to perform network
   address translation for IP packets traveling between private and external networks.
   this demo concentrates on the ICMP ping operation.

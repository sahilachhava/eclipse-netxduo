# Chapter 2 - Installation and Use of NetX Duo

This chapter contains a description of various issues related to installation, setup, and use of the high- performance network stack NetX Duo, including the following: 

## Host Considerations

Embedded development is usually performed on Windows or Linux (Unix) host computers. After the application is compiled, linked, and the executable is generated on the host, it is downloaded to the target hardware for execution.

Usually the target download is done from within the development tool's debugger. After download, the debugger is responsible for providing target execution control (go, halt, breakpoint, etc.) as well as access to memory and processor registers.

Most development tool debuggers communicate with the target hardware via on-chip debug (OCD) connections such as JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) and Background Debug Mode (BDM). Debuggers also communicate with target hardware through In-Circuit Emulation (ICE) connections. Both OCD and ICE connections provide robust solutions with minimal intrusion on the target resident software.

As for resources used on the host, the source code for NetX Duo is delivered in ASCII format and requires approximately 1 Mbytes of space on the host computer's hard disk.

## Target Considerations

NetX Duo requires between 5 KBytes and 45 KBytes of Read-Only Memory (ROM) on the target. Another 1 to 5KBytes of the target's Random Access Memory (RAM) are required for the NetX Duo thread stack and other global data structures.

In addition, NetX Duo requires the use of two ThreadX timer objects and one ThreadX mutex object. These facilities are used for periodic processing needs and thread protection inside the NetX Duo protocol stack.

## Product Distribution

NetX Duo can be obtained from our public source code repository at <https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo/>.

The following is a list of several important files in the repository:

**nx_api.h**  
C header file containing all system equates, data structures, and service prototypes.

**nx_port.h**
C header file containing all development-tool and targetspecific data definitions and structures. 

**demo_netx.c**
C file containing a small demo application.

**nx.a (or nx.lib)**  
Binary version of the NetX Duo C library that is distributed with the standard package.

## NetX Duo Installation

NetX Duo is installed by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine. The following is typical syntax for creating a clone of the NetX Duo repository on your PC:

```c
    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-threadx/netxduo
```

Alternatively you can download a copy of the repository using the download button on the GitHub main page.

You will also find instructions for building the NetX Duo library on the front page of the online repository.

> **Important:** *Application software needs access to the NetX Duo library file (usually **nx.a** or **nx.lib**) and the C include files **nx_api.h, and nx_port.h**. This is accomplished either by setting the appropriate path for the development tools or by copying these files into the application development area.*

## Using NetX Duo

Using NetX Duo is easy. Basically, the application code must include ***nx_api.h*** during compilation and link with the NetX Duo library ***nx.a*** (or ***nx.lib**)*.

The following are the four easy steps required to build a NetX Duo application:

| Step  | Description  |
|---|---|
|Step&nbsp;1: |Include the ***nx_api.h*** file in all application files that use NetX Duo services or data structures.|
|Step&nbsp;2: |Initialize the NetX Duo system by calling ***nx_system_initialize*** from the ***tx_application_define*** function or an application thread.|
|Step&nbsp;3: |Create an IP instance, enable the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), if necessary, and any sockets after ***nx_system_initialize*** is called.|
|Step&nbsp;4: |Compile application source and link with the NetX Duo runtime library ***nx.a*** (or ***nx.lib***). The resulting image can be downloaded to the target and executed!|

## Troubleshooting

Each NetX Duo port is delivered with one or more demonstrations that execute on an actual network or via a simulated network driver. It is always a good idea to get the demonstration system running first.

If the demonstration system does not run properly, perform the following operations to narrow the problem:

1. Determine how much of the demonstration is running.
2. Increase stack sizes in any new application threads.
3. Recompile the NetX Duo library with the appropriate debug options listed in the configuration option section.
4. Examine the NX_IP structure to see if packets are being sent or received.
5. Examine the default packet pool to see if there are available packets.
6. Ensure the network driver is supplying ARP and IP packets with its headers on 4-byte boundaries for applications requiring IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity.
7. Temporarily bypass any recent changes to see if the problem disappears or changes.

## Configuration Options

There are several configuration options when building the NetX Duo library and the application using NetX Duo. The configuration options can be defined in the application source, on the command line, or within the ***nx_user.h*** include file, unless otherwise specified.

> **Note:** *Options defined in **nx_user.h** are applied only if the application and NetX Duo library are built with* **NX_INCLUDE_USER_DEFINE_FILE** *defined.*
